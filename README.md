# LSTM Air Pollution Forecasting

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **Air Pollution Forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks**.  
The dataset used is the **Beijing PM2.5 dataset** which contains air quality and meteorological data.  
The goal is to forecast future pollution levels based on historical trends.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Building and training the LSTM model
- Model Evaluation
- Visualization of results
